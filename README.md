csit415 project 

db using sql was created
import db into phpadmin when changes are made 
so changes are visible in localhost

put php files in htdocs/project
direct to that directory for php files
when launching them on your browser

please use the same format and style as 
i have made in styles.css.
although simple, please use index.php as reference

index.php is our main page. 

areg.php is "admin registry". this will remain
private for us to use as of right now. instead of manually
inputting this information I made a php for it. plus the PHP
takes care of hashing and I have put a few security measures for 
sql injection

creg.php is "customer registry". this is also private to
admins/devs. serves similar as areg. take a look at them and their 
source code. 

i think we should stick to dark theme websites.
